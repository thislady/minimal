        <h1>This "Talented" Lady</h1>

       <p>Talent was never a missing thing in our house. Mom and Dad had three beautiful, smart, funny and talented girls.</p>

        <p>I was the wild one. Even the CB Handle I was given (without prompting) was WildChild. I have never wanted to be like anyone else.
        I always wanted to be more than I was yesterday. It was just a vein wish.</p>

        <p>I have been learning code for years. Without really knowing I was learning it. I was merely trying to keep my sites up and running.</p>

        <p>I guess it has become a thing. I have a passion for this. One I did not really know I had.</p>

        <p>You see, I am people person. People person's don't really lock themselves in a room and type out code. At least that is what I thought.</p>

        <p>Yet, here I am.
